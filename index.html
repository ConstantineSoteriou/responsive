                    <p>The streets of London are rumbling as scores of high end street racers flash their extravagant wealth, while neighbors try to get used to the new millionaires.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>The young and rich are often criticized for how they publically display their wealth. From the likes of Dan Bilzerian to the wolf of Wall Street guy, it seems that there is something that makes the young and wealthy seem arrogant and inconsiderate to most of us. In this specific case, the quiet neighborhood of ***** has been disrupted by flashy cars racing in the streets, and extravagant parties are hosted by a group of young millionaires who moved in not long ago.
</p>

                                <div id="attachment_421 " style="width: 310px " class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="# " onclick="$cs.PageCover.mRedir(event, 'method');"><img class="wp-image-421 size-medium " src="images/gcar8.jpg " alt="gcar8 " width="300 " height="187 " ></a>
              <p class="wp-caption-text"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Mercedes AMG parked in London, one of several owned by flamboyant binary options millionaire. British born Baxter imported his cars from Saudi Arabia and has yet to change his licence plates to the UK version, causing some controversy.</span></p>
                        </div>
<p>The complaints about the rude young millionaires infiltrating the exclusive neighborhood got us intrigued. Who are these young people and how can they afford such a lavish lifestyle.</p>
<p>We took to the neighborhood on a pleasant Friday afternoon, and immediately got surprised by four supercars zooming by just yards from us. Although they were mostly a blur, I managed to see a young man in his thirties by the wheel. We jumped in our car and started looking for the supercar convoy, and it wasn’t long before we saw all four cars illegally parked outside a café, all with parking tickets already under the wipers.</p>
<p>A group of four young men were sitting in a roped off section outside the café, singing and making so much noise that you might have thought they owned the place. There was something about them that made me feel like they knew something the rest of us are missing out on, and they were maybe laughing at how we were blind to some hidden truth. I sat for a full five minutes trying to understand what they were talking about, and pondered what is it that they all knew. When they got up to go back to their cars, I saw an opportunity I couldn’t miss out on, so I called out to the young man I’d seen driving the Lamborghini earlier and said: “I love your car, but take it easy, there are kids around here.” He smiled and asked me if I wanted a give it a spin. He was so unconcerned, as if he didn’t care if I mangled it. He didn’t have to ask me twice, and while I struggle with the racing gearbox a conversation began that made me understand something intense.</p>




<h3>They do see the truth, and we are all blind…</h3>
<p>The gentleman whose car I was driving is a 29 year-old South African, who took his savings just 5 years ago and invested in Binary Options. According to him, all four friends have developed their own trading strategies that allows them to make obscene amounts of money, but when they merged all four systems into one general strategy, huge things started to happen and they’ve never looked backsince then.</p>
<p>“We have made so much money with this that we don’t even know how much money we exactly have anymore!” claims ****. “We’re not trying to disturb anyone on purpose, but a lot of money buys a lot of freedom. We are always welcome back wherever we go because we always give three times more than the bill. I’m not a bad guy… I even donate to charity. We are what we are, guys in our 30s that want to enjoy their money.  Even in our hometown people still stare at us with envy. It’s been a few years already… and we’ve decided to stop caring and enjoy life while we can.</p>
<p>When asking how lucrative Binary options could be, *** grinned mischievously</p>
                <div class="entry-thumbnail"><img width="777 " height="437 " src="images/truth.jpg " class="attachment-content-single size-content-single wp-post-image " alt="Millionaire Gold Plated Car Owner Revealed To Be Colin Baxter, Work From Home Binary Options Trader. "></div>
<blockquote>“I made the money to buy this car in less than 6 months.”</blockquote>
<p>I was amazed by this, how is it that binary options are not a household name like an investment firm’s life insurance policy?</p>
<p>According to *****, there are a few golden rules to succeeding in Binary options trading that are an absolute must.</p>
<p>“It’s not brain surgery. There are tons of brokers out there you should give a wide birth to. Make sure you choose a broker that provides trading signals and a good education package to explain the basics and what needs to be done in order to make money. Once you find a broker that you are comfortable with, sign up and make the minimum deposit. Download the software and play with a demo account while you wait for an Account Manager to be assigned to you. When he calls, ask him to show you how to use the trading tools and tell him you know about the bonus funds. They’ll throw in a couple of hundred quid if you ask for it. Oh yeah, don’t put all your eggs in one basket… ever! Start with 10% of your portfolio and slowly build. That’s it. Take your time and don’t do anything stupid.”</p>

<p>And that’s it? That simple? I was sure that there was more he was not telling me.</p>


<p>My first impression of **** was totally wrong. I’d been so sure that people who have made so much money, so quickly, don’t have a sense of pride in accomplishment. For most people, making a million would take a lifetime, but the fast moving markets of Binary Trading means people like **** can get to the top much faster and skip the hard work and character building struggle that takes away the arrogance that **** and these selfish road racers are displaying.</p>

<p>After asking for additional tips, and really trying to get some explanation about the strategies.</p>

<p>**** said “We were all newbies going into this, we had no idea what financial markets were back then or how to manage a portfolio or analyze risk. Hell, we didn’t even know what we were trading some times,” he said with a smile. “All we knew is that we invested x and made a ton of money every day.”</p>


<p>“It sounds cheesy,” **** went on to say, “but it’s not as hard as it sounds. I was assigned an Account Manager when I first signed up. I pretty much followed what he was saying from the start and I’m still doing it today. You see, what works for small money works for big money too. My Account Manager taught me money management, risk analysis... back then I didn’t know any of that stuff. I followed the rules, used the tools, and my portfolio started growing.”</p>

<p>After getting to know the market and making steady income from his new hobby, **** started to understand the market better.</p>

<p>“When you do this for a while and make okay money, you are actually investing in your own knowledge. What I learned in that first year was the foundation for the money I have today. I just decided to raise the stakes as my account grew, every time raising my daily limit a bit more with the money I was making from my winning trades. I could have cashed out much sooner, but decided to use the money to build the account and make real money. I wanted more, something good enough to quit everything else… trade full time, and make sure I make millions. That was the best decision I ever made, I built a fortune instead of just paying for a vacation and a new car, and I am thankful to my account managers along the way who taught me how to manage my accounts and increase them, I owe them a lot!</p>

<p>I asked **** what to lookout for if someone was thinking about becoming a trader.</p>

<p>“Well, brokers that are unregulated are always a risk. Companies who don’t offer any assistance or education package or work with signals providers are not recommended. Make sure you have a good connection with your account manager, you will need his assistance and guidance, and if you don’t feel a connection, ask for another one until you find one that understands your needs and helps you build and plan the milestones to success.”</p>


<p>“Any other tips, ***?”</p>

<p>“Well, if you want to follow in my footsteps, I recommend you check this broker. They have the best educational package and account managers in my opinion, and since I have accounts with all the major brokers, I can honestly say they are the best ones I’ve worked with so far.</p>

<p>As john dropped me off by my car and sped away, I couldn’t stop thinking about the absolute freedom and care free attitude that John and his associates had, and all I wanted is a piece of that to myself. I know that it cannot be as easy as John said, but I’m sure I can do it. After all, I just sat with 4 people who made it big, and none of them knew more than me going into it. Ive seen live proof that this works for some, so even if I don’t make it big time like John and his friends, I would still be able to get closer to that freedom, and definitely would do better financially. That’s all I need to know in order to try! </p>
